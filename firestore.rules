/**
 * @file Overview
 * This ruleset defines access control for the Artisan Showcase application's product catalog.
 *
 * @corePhilosophy
 * Employs a public-read, admin-write model for the `/products` collection. This allows for open listing and viewing of products while restricting modifications to authorized admins only.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * Data is stored in a flat `/products` collection.  Each document represents a single product.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - Public Read: The `/products` collection is publicly readable to allow showcasing the products.
 * - Admin-Only Writes: Only authenticated admins are allowed to create, update, or delete products.  There is currently no role-based authentication, so any logged-in user is considered an admin.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 *  There is no denormalization as authentication is provided by the firebase auth.
